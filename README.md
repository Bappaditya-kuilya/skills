```
> make me a portfolio, my name is Julio
```

That's the whole brief. The agent works as creative director, designer and creative developer
in one, then hands back a site it has already checked in a real browser.

## Quick start

```bash
npx skills add wheresryan22/anatomy -g   # optional: interactive isometric explainer figures
npx skills add juliobsz/skills -g
```

Open a **new** agent session, then type `/awwwards` or just ask for a website.

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ac28c25-9796-4bce-8fa6-4dcc6df55b8b

## Install

Install with the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). It runs through `npx`, so
there's nothing to install first, and it detects your agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Copilot and more) and lets you pick.

```bash
npx skills add juliobsz/skills -g
```

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npx skills add juliobsz/skills -g -a claude-code` | Claude Code only (use `codex`, `cursor`… for others) |
| `npx skills add juliobsz/skills` | This project only, instead of your user folder |
| `npx skills add juliobsz/skills -g --copy` | Copy the files instead of linking them |
| `npx skills update -g` | Update to the latest version |
| `npx skills remove awwwards -g` | Uninstall |

The CLI collects anonymous usage data. Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` to turn
it off.

<details>
<summary>Claude Code plugin</summary>

If you prefer Claude Code's plugin system, which updates the skill for you:

```
/plugin install awwwards --marketplace juliobsz/skills
```

On Claude Code before 2.1.275, run `/plugin marketplace add juliobsz/skills` and then
`/plugin install awwwards@juliobsz`. The skill then runs as `/awwwards:awwwards`. Use the
plugin or the skills CLI, not both, or the skill shows up twice.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

Copy the `awwwards/` folder into your agent's skills directory, for example
`~/.claude/skills/awwwards`. Any agent that reads `SKILL.md` skills can use it.
</details>

### Works with /anatomy

[/anatomy](https://github.com/wheresryan22/anatomy) by wheresryan22 is an open-source skill
for detailed, interactive isometric figures that explain an idea as a real physical object.
Install it next to `/awwwards` and the site can get one "how it works" section built as a real
explainer figure, styled to the site's palette and grid.

```bash
npx skills add wheresryan22/anatomy -g
```

It's optional. Without it, `/awwwards` builds that section another way, and tells you at the
end when a figure would have helped.

### Requirements

- **Node 22.20+** for the skills CLI. The helper scripts need Node 20+.
- **Playwright** in the site's project for screenshots and the OG image, and **axe-core** for
  the accessibility pass. The skill installs both as dev dependencies when it needs them, and
  uses a Chromium you already have when it can.
- **A model that can read images**, so the QA loop can look at its own screenshots.
- **A Vercel, Netlify or Cloudflare account** only if you want it to deploy.

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

- **`/awwwards` isn't found.** Start a new session; agents read their skills folder at startup.
  Then run `npx skills list -g` to see where it was installed.
- **It shows up twice.** You installed it two ways (for example the skills CLI and the plugin).
  Remove one with `npx skills remove awwwards -g` or `/plugin uninstall awwwards@juliobsz`.
- **Installed into the wrong agent.** Name the target with `-a`, for example `-a codex`.
- **Screenshots fail with "Playwright not found".** Run `npm i -D playwright` in the site's
  project. If it reports no Chromium, run `npx playwright install chromium` once.
</details>

## Why

Ask an agent for "a portfolio" and you get the same site everyone gets: purple gradient, three
cards, "elevate your brand". This skill replaces that default with a process.

- **A concept that belongs to you.** Three ideas from different territories (your name, your
  craft, your place), scored on originality and fit.
- **A real design system.** Palette by role, curated free fonts, grid and motion language,
  written to `DESIGN.md` and tested against a "genericness check".
- **Motion with intent.** GSAP, Lenis and WebGL (OGL) where they earn their place, with one
  signature moment and everything else quiet.
- **Real copy.** No lorem ipsum, fake awards or invented metrics. Anything made up is marked
  as a placeholder and listed at the end.
- **Verified, not assumed.** A production build, a crawling audit and real-browser screenshots
  on desktop, mobile and reduced motion, scored against a rubric until every category hits 8/10.

Its quality bar is the work that wins [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com) Site of the Day. The
site doesn't need to be submitted anywhere; it just has to be that good.

## Usage

Ask in one line and let the agent decide. It writes its assumptions down instead of running a
questionnaire.

```
make me a portfolio, my name is Ana
a site for my architecture studio in Lisbon, we do small houses
launch page for a mechanical keyboard called Kestrel, it should feel insane
redesign this landing page so it could win site of the day
```

Better input gives a better site. Your real name, what you do, where you are and two or three
real projects let the concept come from your story instead of a placeholder.

## How it works

| Phase | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Brief** | Infers who it's for, the audience and the site's job. Missing facts become written assumptions |
| **Concept** | Three concepts from different territories (your name, your craft's materials, your place, how you work, a formal system), scored on originality and fit. The winner becomes a one-line idea with a signature moment |
| **Art direction** | Palette by role, type pairing from a curated free-font library, grid, rhythm and motion language, all written to `DESIGN.md`. Then a "genericness test" kills anything an average model would have produced |
| **Build** | Semantic HTML that looks finished with motion off. Then reveals, page transitions, a loader that tracks real loading, and the signature moment |
| **QA loop** | Production build, a crawling audit (SEO, metadata, accessibility, weight, placeholder copy, AI-copy tells) and real-browser screenshots on desktop, mobile, reduced motion and mid-transition. It also measures LCP and CLS on a throttled phone, runs axe and tabs through every page. The agent reads every frame, a fresh critic subagent that never saw the plan scores the site against the rubric, and the agent fixes things until every category hits 8/10 |
| **Ship** | OG image, favicon, sitemap, robots, then deploy to Vercel, Netlify or Cloudflare (only after you confirm) |

### Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) by default, and for anything with app features.
- **Astro** for content-only showcases where motion is the product: about 75 KB of JS against
  about 250 KB.
- **Your stack** when you run it inside an existing project.

All three use [GSAP](https://gsap.com) (every plugin is free now), [Lenis](https://lenis.dev)
for smooth scroll and [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) for WebGL. The motion engine is
framework-agnostic TypeScript, shipped as documented code instead of a template: it runs on
one clock, reverts every effect on navigation, runs transitions in parallel with the next page
loading, and keeps content visible without JavaScript or with reduced motion.

### Principles it won't break

- One idea, one signature moment, everything else quiet.
- Every frame works as a still poster before any motion is added.
- The native cursor stays. Reduced motion gets a complete, calm site. Phones get a composed
  layout, not a shrunken one.
- No fake awards, logos or metrics. No lorem ipsum. No em dashes or "elevate your brand" copy.
- No purple gradients, glassmorphism or three-card grids unless the concept truly calls for
  them.

## Limits

- **It takes a while.** A full run is concept, design system, build and several rounds of
  screenshots and fixes. Expect a long session and heavy token use, not a quick snippet.
- **Results depend on the model.** It was built and tested with Claude Code and Codex. The
  concept and the visual QA are only as good as the model doing them.
- **Content is yours to finish.** Without real projects, photos and copy, the site ships with
  clearly marked placeholders that you replace.
- **8/10 is its own score.** The rubric keeps it honest, but you're the final judge.

## Standalone scripts

The helpers in `awwwards/scripts/` work on any site, so you can use them on their own:

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/awwwards/scripts/audit.mjs https://your-site.com/
node ~/.claude/skills/awwwards/scripts/shoot.mjs https://your-site.com/ --crawl --nav
```

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `audit.mjs` | Crawl a build: SEO, a11y, weight, placeholders, AI-copy tells |
| `shoot.mjs` | Screenshots of every page type: LCP/CLS on a throttled phone, FPS, overflow, tap targets, axe, keyboard focus, transitions (needs Playwright; axe-core optional) |
| `og.mjs` | Render the OG image from the live hero (needs Playwright) |
| `font.mjs` | Self-host Fontshare / Google fonts (CSS or `next/font` output) |
| `photos.mjs` | Contact sheets of free photos for marked placeholders |
| `serve.mjs` | Static server for build output |

## Security

A skill is instructions your agent follows, and this one has it run builds and scripts on your
machine. Read `awwwards/SKILL.md` before installing, as you would any code you run. Nothing is
deployed without your confirmation.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially for bugs found in real builds and new
patterns in `awwwards/references/`.

1. Fork the repo and create a branch.
2. Make the change. A skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md`; the skills CLI finds any top-level
   folder that has one. For the Claude Code plugin, also add an entry to
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
3. Test it: `npx skills add . -g -a claude-code`, then run the skill in an agent.
4. Open a pull request. The template asks what changed and what you built to check it; CI
   checks script syntax, `SKILL.md` frontmatter, the plugin marketplace and that the skills
   CLI finds every skill, on Linux, macOS and Windows.
